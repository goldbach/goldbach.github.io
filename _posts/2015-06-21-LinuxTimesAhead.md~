# The programable datacenter

I'm about to build a modern infracture at work. 
And I'll blog about it, mostly to remember what I'm doing and why. 
And to share information with colleagues and the world.  

We'll be running a zeromq broker pushing trader quotes between desks and calibration servers.
A redis server to save the latest broadcast from zeromq and a REST api to access data in redis.  

Also, a database of trades from different trade systems with latest version of the trade. i.e a cache. 
This will be in Cassandra and will have a REST api as well.
